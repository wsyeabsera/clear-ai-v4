# Documentation Sections Remaining

The following sections still need to be created:

## API Reference
- planner-agent.md
- executor-agent.md
- shared-types.md
- tools.md

## Tutorials
- first-plan.md
- executing-plans.md
- custom-tools.md
- llm-customization.md

## Advanced Topics
- parameter-resolution.md
- dependency-analysis.md
- error-handling.md
- performance.md

These sections can be expanded from the existing codebase and would provide comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the system.
